sgpFlowStateData is an environment (an **R** object of class environment) embedded as part of the [sgpFlow package](https://centerforassessment.github.io/sgpFlow) containing information on state assessment
programs, organized by state. The environment contains, for example, achievement level cutscores and labels for the state assessments, assessment name and
abbreviation, growth cutscores and labels, information on vertical scaling, and knots and boundaries used for sgpFlow analyses at the state level. The cutscores,
in particular, are used to calculate growth-to-standard/projection values. States included in the data set include:
